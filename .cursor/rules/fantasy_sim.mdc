When working with C++ code in this project:
- The command line environment is in Powershell
- Build using the prebuilt build scripts (scripts/build.bat or .sh)
- Follow the existing ECS (Entity Component System) architecture
- Use the Platform abstraction layer (IInput, IVideo) rather than direct SDL calls
